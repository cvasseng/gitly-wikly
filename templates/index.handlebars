Gitly Wikly is a simple Wiki-esque application, that scans the folder it was started in for markdown files, and indexes them. You can edit documents by clicking the pencil icon on the top right when a document is loaded.

If there's a .git folder in the folder in which Gitly Wikly was started, changes to documents will result in a git add + commit + pull + push.

For the git integration to work, git must be installed on your system, and available in your path.

## References

When enclosing sentences/words in double square brackets, a reference to the current document is exported. When this sentence/word appear in other documents, a cross reference will be added on the right side.

This makes it easy to connect documents indirectly.

As a concrete example: If document A contains a defined keyword "this is a keyword" in double square brackets, and document B contains the string (i.e. not in double square brackets) "this is a keyword", upon reading document B a "this is a keyword" entry will be created in the right panel, and the string highlighted, both of which can be clicked to peek at the documents "exporting" that reference.

## Syntax

[[Gitly Wikly]] uses standard markdown syntax, with the addition of double square brackets which indicate something that should be referenced/auto sourced.

### Meta Information
Documents carry meta information in their header:

      title: My Document
      categories: Category 1, Category 2, ...
      tags: Tag 1, Tag 2, ...
      ===
      Document body goes here!

Note that the `===` part is what separates the meta from the actual document.
